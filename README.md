Introducing **SpeedyDrop**, an innovative app set to redefine local commerce by ensuring 30-minute deliveries within a 10km radius. Built using Flutter for a seamless cross-platform experience and leveraging Firebase for scalable and secure backend management, SpeedyDrop acts as a bridge between local vendors and consumers. The app provides a user-friendly platform where vendors can showcase their inventory, and users can browse and order products effortlessly for swift delivery.

### Business Model

SpeedyDrop employs a dynamic pricing strategy to establish a sustainable revenue model. The base delivery charge is a competitive Rs10 per kilometer. Additional charges are applied based on the size of the ordered products, acknowledging the logistical complexities of larger or bulkier items. The app introduces a unique condition where the delivery cost decreases by 1% for every minute of delay, encouraging timely deliveries and ensuring transparency in the cost structure. 

The 30-minute delivery commitment applies when ordering from a single store. If items are selected from different stores, the delivery time will adjust accordingly. The countdown timer starts only when the rider accepts the order, ensuring that the 30-minute commitment reflects the time from acceptance to delivery.

### Strategic Prioritization

SpeedyDrop prioritizes smaller, bike-transportable items for quick and cost-effective deliveries. Larger or heavier items are accommodated with additional charges reflecting increased effort and resources. This strategic prioritization ensures that the app meets diverse delivery needs efficiently.
